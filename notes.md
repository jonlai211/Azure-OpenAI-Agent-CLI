## Advantages

- No need for a proxy throughout the process
- No need for an international credit card
- Supports using a debit card (Visa)

## Steps

1. **Register a [Microsoft Azure](https://portal.azure.com/#home) account**

2. **Link a payment method to your Microsoft account**
   You can use a Visa card or Alipay. Note that you won't need to pay anything extra before you use up the initial $200 credit.

3. **Create a subscription on the Azure homepage**
   Click on the free trial for new users. The default subscription name is "Subscription 1".

4. **Create an Azure OpenAI subscription**
   Go back to the homepage and create an Azure OpenAI subscription. The first time you create it, you need to fill out a form. For the enterprise email, use a non-personal email, such as a university email. The approval usually takes less than 24 hours.

5. **Deploy in the Azure OpenAI Studio**
   Note that the free account may not support GPT-4 but can support GPT-4-o. Ensure that the deployment name matches the instance name to avoid recognition issues.

6. **Retrieve your Endpoint and API key**
   Go to the Azure OpenAI instance page to find your Endpoint and API key for future deployments.

7. **Test in the Azure OpenAI Studio**
   You can directly test your deployments in the Azure OpenAI Studio.
